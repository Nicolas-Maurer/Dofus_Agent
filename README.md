# Dofus Agent with OCR & LLM Integration
This project is designed for educational purposes to explore the use of **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** in building an autonomous agent for the game **Dofus**. The primary goal is to demonstrate how OCR and LLMs can be integrated to create a game-playing agent capable of interacting with in-game elements, recognizing map coordinates, and making decisions based on a grid layout.

# Features 
- **OCR integration:**
Uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to identify and extract text and item coordinates from in-game screenshots.
- **Grid and Element Representation:**
The game map is represented as a grid, with items (like wheat) stored as elements on the grid, allowing the agent to reason about their locations and quantities.
- **Agent Behavior:**
The agent can call tools to move the player, navigate the game grid, recognize in-game elements (like wheat), and make decisions based on its surroundings.
